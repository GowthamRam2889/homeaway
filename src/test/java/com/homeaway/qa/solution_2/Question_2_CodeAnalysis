    Code Analysis / White Box Testing:

        1) First Bug :

            There has been no validation in the "addRecipientToAllMessages()" method for the condition:
                when ArrayList<Messages> is null. The Condition where the Collection is Null or Empty is not handled


        2) Second Bug :

             The following statement is wrong
                if(successfulMessages.isEmpty())
                {
                    recipient.addRecipient(CurrentUser, successfulMessages);
                }

             If the "successfulMessages" list is empty - adding to the recipient list is not right.

             It shoud be :
                if(!successfulMessages.isEmpty())
                {
                    recipient.addRecipient(CurrentUser, successfulMessages);
                }


        3) Third Bug :

            canReceiveMessage() should return "False"
