 My Questions to the Product Manager :

    1) What is the accessibility of a Guest user? Will he still be able to create an account on the fly and access?

    2) Who are writable users ? difference between a "user" and a "writable user"?

    3) Can a writable user be able to just view other user profile data ? If so what data is available for him/her ?

    4) CSR can edit any user - does that mean he can change the password as well for any user? what kind of constraints does the CSR
       has on its users?

    5) If Edit Profile and Change Password has the same behavior - then why is password field not in the "Edit Profile" page - What kind of
       behavior is same here - the Http operation ? or object change ? or anything else ??

    6) What should happen when the CSR (editing user A) and the user A editing his profile - at the same time -? Who will have more access ?

    7) Does the application work with all browsers/ OS/ devices etc ? Or it is available at it's best only in Certain devices and browsers ?

    8) How is the non-human or Robot validated ?

    9) What if my "Save Profile" is updated concurrently for the same user ? Which password should the application save?

    10) How many chances does the user have to get the right login before the account is locked??
